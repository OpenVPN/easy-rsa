# Overview

easy-rsa is a CLI utility to build and manage a PKI CA. In layman's terms,
this means to create a root certificate authority, and request and sign
certificates, including intermediate CAs and certificate revocation lists (CRL).

# Installation instructions

Easy-RSA's main program is a script, supported by a couple of config files. As such, there is no formal "installation" required. Preparing to use Easy-RSA is as simple as downloading the compressed package (.tar.gz for Linux/Unix or .zip for Windows) and extract it to a location of your choosing. There is no compiling or OS-dependent setup required.

You should install and run Easy-RSA as a non-root (non-Administrator) account as root access is not required.

# Branch structure

The easy-rsa master branch is currently tracking development for the 3.x release
cycle. Please note that, at any given time, master may be broken. Feel free to
create issues against master, but have patience when using the master branch. It
is recommended to use a release, and priority will be given to bugs identified in
the most recent release.

The prior 2.x and 1.x versions are available as release branches for
tracking and possible back-porting of relevant fixes.

Branch layout is:

    master             <- Active: v3.2.x - Rolling.
    v3.<N>.<N>-<LABEL>    Active: Development branches.
    testing               Sandbox: Subject to change without notice.
    v3.1.8                Sunset: Bugfix only for v3.1.7

    The following are NOT compatible with OpenSSL version 3:

    v3.0.6                Inactive: Archived.
    v3.0.5                Inactive: Archived.
    v3.0.4                Inactive: Archived.
    release/3.0           Inactive: Archived.
    release/2.x           Inactive: Archived.
