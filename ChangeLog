Easy-RSA 3 ChangeLog

3.2.0 (TBD)

3.1.7 (2023-10-13)
   * Rewrite vars-auto-detect, adhere to EasyRSA-Advanced.md (#1029)
     Under the hood, this is a considerable change but there are no user
     noticable differences. With the exception of:
     Caveat: The default '$PWD/pki/vars' file is forbidden to change either
             EASYRSA or EASYRSA_PKI, which are both implied by default.
   * EasyRSA-Advanced.md: Correct vars-auto-detect hierarchy (#1029)
     Commit: ecd65065e3303da78811278a154ef7a969c2777b
             EASYRSA/vars is moved to a higher priority than a default PKI.
             vars-auto-detect no longer searches 'easyrsa' program directory.
   * gen-crl: preserve existing crl.pem ownership+mode (#1020)
   * New command: make-vars - Print vars.example (here-doc) to stdout (#1024)
   * show-expire: Calculate cert. expire seconds from DB date (#1023)
   * Update OpenSSL to 3.1.2

3.1.6 (2023-07-18)
   * New commands: 'inline' and 'x509-eku' (#993)
     inline: Build an inline file for a commonName
     x509-eku: Extract X509v3 extended key usage from a certificate
   * Expose serial-check, display-dn, display-san and default-san to
     command line. (#980) (Debugging functions, which remain undocumented)
   * Expand default status to include vars-file and CA status (#973)
   * sign-req: Allow the CSR DN-field order to be preserved (#970)

3.1.5 (2023-06-10)
   * Build Update: script now supports signing and verifying
   * Automate support-file creation (Free packaging) (#964)
   * build-ca: New command option 'raw-ca', abbrevation: 'raw' (#963)

     This 'raw' method, is the most reliable way to build a CA,
     with a password, without writing the CA password to a temp-file.

   This option completely replaces both methods below:

   * build-ca: New option --ca-via-stdin, use SSL -pass* argument 'stdin' (#959)
     Option '--ca-via-stdin' offers no more security than standard method.
     Easy-RSA version 3.1.4 ONLY.

   * build-ca: Replace password temp-files with file-descriptors (#955)
     Using file-descriptors does not work in Windows.
     Easy-RSA version 3.1.3 ONLY.

3.1.4 (2023-05-23)
   * build-ca: New option --ca-via-stdin, use SSL -pass* argument 'stdin' (#959)
   * build-ca: Revert manual CA password method to temp-files (#959)
     Supersedes #955

     Release v3.1.3 was fatally flawed, it would fail to build a CA under Windows.
     Release v3.1.4 is specifically a bugfix ONLY, to resolve the Windows problem.

     See the following commits for further details:
     5d7ad1306d5ebf1588aef77eb3445e70cf5b4ebc
         build-ca: Revert manual CA password method to temp-files
     c11135d19b2e7e7385d28abb1132978c849dfa74
         build-ca: Use OpenSSL password I/O argument 'stdin'
     27870d695a324e278854146afdac5d6bdade9bba
         build-ca: Replace password temp-file method with file-descriptors
