Easy-RSA 3 TODO / wishlist

Feature support:
    * makefile
        * It may be useful to port the Makefile from the 2.x series
        * This may be desirable for building and downstream packaging
    * add pkcs11 support
        * Much of this may be distro-dependent
        * Keep platform-specific tools separate from platform-neutral code
    * add detection for duplicate CN prior to OpenSSL failure
        * This gets tricky if `updatedb` requires a CA passphrase
	* It would help to warn users before OpenSSL throws errors

Longer term wishlist:
    * Support openssl's -password source mechanism:
        * allow for batching currently "unbatchable" operations, like pkcs12
        * support one password input that can apply to multiple operations
        * support a variety of password sources (interactive, pipe, file, etc)
