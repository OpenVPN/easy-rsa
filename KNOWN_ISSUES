* Issue #24: Incorrect variable name in vars.example

    vars.example does not currently handle un-commenting a line that references
    a variable that was not also defined earlier with set_var. Currently it is
    necessary to un-comment the line referencing the used variables.

    When this issue is corrected, this work-around will no longer be necessary.
