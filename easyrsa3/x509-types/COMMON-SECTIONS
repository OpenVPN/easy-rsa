# X509 extensions added to every signed cert

# This file is included for every cert signed, and by default does nothing.
# It could be used to add sections shared by every cert, such as a CDP as
# demonstrated in the following example:

# in COMMON
#crlDistributionPoints = @crlDistributionPoints_values
# in COMMON-SECTIONS (here)
#[ crlDistributionPoints_values ]
#URI.1=http://example.net/pki/crl.der
