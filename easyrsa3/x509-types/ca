# X509 extensions for a ca

# Note that basicConstraints will be overridden by Easy-RSA when defining a
# CA_PATH_LEN for CA path length limits. You could also do this here
# manually as in the following example in place of the existing line:
#
# basicConstraints = critical, CA:TRUE, pathlen:1

basicConstraints = critical, CA:TRUE
subjectKeyIdentifier = hash
authorityKeyIdentifier = keyid:always,issuer:always
keyUsage = critical, cRLSign, keyCertSign
