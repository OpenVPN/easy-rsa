To use Easy-RSA in a protected system directory, you must have
elevated privileges via 'Windows User Access Control'.
You can try 'run-as admin' but that may also fail.

It is recommended to use Easy-RSA in your User/home directory.

Please try using one of the following solutions:
* Use the Start Menu item: 'Start Easy-RSA Shell (Non-Admin)'
* Or, in a Non-Admin command prompt window, run two commands:

    cd '\Program Files\Openvpn\easy-rsa\'
    EasyRSA-Start.bat /no-admin

These will start EasyRSA in your user's 'home directory/easy-rsa'

Press enter to exit."
